    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Inspired by a myth of buying heaven and hell</i></p>
    <p id="Statement" class="w3-justify">
	    In the Middle Ages, the act of selling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indulgences</a>, which served as a remission of punishment in Christianity, got out of hand. To finance crusades and cathedrals, church pardoners would go around selling indulgences for large sums of money. They went as far as promising the buyers eternal salvation. Commoners, believing they were buying "a piece of heaven" for themselves and their loved ones, paid a lot for those indulgences.
	    <br><br>
	    The myth begins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Luther</a>, a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation, being provoked by these acts.
	    As a counteract, Luther went to a priest and asked to buy hell. The surprised priest, in his greed, was glad to sell Luther a document stating him as the sole owner of hell. 
	    <br><br>
	    Luther then went to the town square, showing this document to the people. Shouting that they should stop buying indulgences, since he was the sole owner of Hell, and won't let anyone enter it. This rendered the plot of buying heaven unnecessary and caused the church trouble.
	    <br><br>
	    Another version of this myth states that a deviant merchant was the one to buy hell, which he sold back to the church for some great returns.

    <h2>Not just artwork</h2>
    <p id="NotJustArt" class="w3-justify">
	    This work was made as a demonstration of the strength of Fractional NFTs. I find the mythical inspiration interesting, but it's not just art. It's a message. It's vouching for unrestricted distributed verified ownership. This starts now with JPEGs and PNGs, but will evolve into global free ownership of businesses. Ownership of physical and intellectual  property. Ownership of freedom and thought. No more fuckos controlling what you own and how you own it.
    </p>

    <h2>A little piece of heaven, or the whole lot of hell</h2>
        <p id="artwork" class="w3-justify">
                This collection contains two pieces of artwork. Just like the myth. You can buy a piece of Heaven as a fractional NFT; Or choose the side of Luther and buy all of Hell, as a single NFT.

    <h2>About the author</h2>
      <p id="author" class="w3-justify">
	    I grew up in a Middle Eastern country, ruled by a dictatorship. Cornered by corruption and American sanctions into a limited financial system. A couple of months before I turned 18, the government response to the revolution became extra violent in my city. That's when we packed and left. In early 2013, I found out about Bitcoin. The first thing that came to mind is <em>this is something my ex-government cannot control</em>. Got doubts about decentralization? Try living in a dictatorship. Got doubts about crypto's utility as a payment method? Things take time to mature. Come along for the ride.
